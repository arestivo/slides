#SQL

* **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage.
* A special purpose language to manage data stored in a **relational** database.
* Based on **relational algebra**.
* Pronounced *Sequel*

---

# History

* Early **70's** SEQUEL Developed at IBM
* **1986** SQL-86 and SQL-87 Ratified by ANSI and ISO.
* **1989** SQL-89
* **1992** SQL-92 Also know as SQL2.
* **1999** SQL:1999 Also known as SQL3 Includes regurlar expressions, recursive queries, triggers, non-scalar data types and some object-oriented expressions.
* **2003** SQL:2003 XML support and auto-generated values.
* **2006** SQL:2006 XQuery support.
* **2008** SQL:2008.
* **2011** SQL:2011.

---

# Standard

* Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, every database system implements it in a slightly different way.
* These slides will try to adhere to the standard as much as possible.
* Sometimes we'll deviate and talk specifically about **PostgreSQL**.

# Selecting Data

---

# SELECT and FROM

* **SELECT** and **FROM** are the most basic SQL query operators.
* They allows to specify which tables (FROM) and columns (SELECT) we want to retrieve from the database.
* The result of an SQL query is also a table.

---

# Selecting all columns

To select all columns from a table we can use an *

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;
```

.sqltable[
|id|name|salary|taxes|dep_num
|-|-|
|1 | John Doe    | 1000 | 200 | 1
|2 | Jane Doe    | 800  | 100 | 2
|3 | John Smith  | 1200 | 350 | 2
|4 | Jane Roe    | 1000 | 200 | 3
|5 | Richard Roe | 900  | 0   | NULL

# Choosing columns

We can select only some columns

```sql
SELECT id, name FROM employee;
```

.sqltable[
|id|name
|-|-|
|1 | John Doe    |
|2 | Jane Doe    |
|3 | John Smith  |
|4 | Jane Roe    |
|5 | Richard Roe |
]

.box_info[Selects columns id and name from table employee]

---

# Column operations

We can also perform any operations between columns

```sql
SELECT id, name, salary - taxes FROM employee;
```

.sqltable[
|id|name|salary - taxes
|-|-|
|1 | John Doe    | 800
|2 | Jane Doe    | 700
|3 | John Smith  | 850
|4 | Jane Roe    | 800
|5 | Richard Roe | 900
]

.box_info[Selects columns id, name and the difference between salary and taxes from table employee]

---

# Renaming columns

Any column can be renamed using the **AS** operator

```sql
SELECT id AS num, name, salary - taxes AS net_salary FROM employee;
```

.sqltable[
|num|name|net_salary
|-|-|
|1 | John Doe    | 800
|2 | Jane Doe    | 700
|3 | John Smith  | 850

# Filtering Rows

---

# WHERE

* The **WHERE** command allows us to filter which rows we want in our result table according to a condition.
* The condition can use any comparison operator (<, >, <=, <>, ...) and can be composed using AND, OR and NOT.

---
# Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dep_num = 2 OR salary <= 900;
```

.sqltable[
|id|name|salary|taxes|dep_num
|-|-|
|2 | Jane Doe    | 800  | 100 | 2
|3 | John Smith  | 1200 | 350 | 2
|5 | Richard Roe | 900  | 0   | NULL
]

.box_info[Employees from department 2 or a salary lower or equal to 900]

---

# Example

To test if a value is null, we have to use the special **IS NULL** operator.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE dep_num IS NULL;
```

.sqltable[
|id|name|salary|taxes|dep_num
|-|-|
|5 | Richard Roe | 900  | 0   | NULL
]

.box_info[Employees from department 2 or a salary lower or equal to 900]

Use **IS NOT NULL** to select rows where a certain attribute is not null.

---

# Removing duplicates

We can remove duplicates from the final result by using the DISTINCT operator

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM employee;
```

.sqltable[
|salary
|-|-|
|1000
|800
|1200
|900
]

.box_info[Selects the different salaries in the database]

# Set operators

---

# Set operators

Two tables are compatible for being used in a set operation if they have the same **number of columns** and the **type** of each column is **compatible**:

* The **UNION** between two tables (R1 and R2) is a table that includes all lines that are present in R1 or R2.
* The **INTERSECT**ion between two tables (R1 and R2) is a table that includes all lines that are present in R1 and R2.
* The difference (**EXCEPT**) between two tables (R1 and R2) is a table that includes all lines that are present in R1 but not in R2.

With all these operators, **duplicate** rows are **eliminated** automatically.

# Joining Tables

# Cartesian product

* The cartesian product allows us to combine rows from **different tables**.
* To use it, we just have to indicate which tables we want to combine using commas to separate them.
* The result is a table containing the columns of all tables and **all possible combinations** of rows.
* Also known as **CROSS JOIN**.

# Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee;

# Solving ambiguities

When selecting from more than one table, columns with the same name might lead to ambiguities.

```sql
SELECT id, name, name FROM employee, department;
```

To solve them we must use the table name before the column name.

```sql
SELECT id, employee.name, department.name FROM employee, department;
```

# Join LEFT, RIGHT and FULL

* Sometimes, when joining tables, some of the rows are left out as they do not match any rows on the other table.
* If we want these rows to be present in the result, we must use what is called and *outer join*.
* There are three types of *outer joins*:
  * LEFT - Rows on the **left** table that do not match any row in the right table are kept.
  * RIGHT - Rows on the **right** table that do not match any row in the left table are kept.
  * FULL - Rows on any of the tables that do not match any row in the other table are kept.

MIN, MAX, SUM, AVG and COUNT

SELECT MAX(value)             FROM table; -- 3
SELECT SUM(value)             FROM table; -- 8
SELECT AVG(value)             FROM table; -- 2
SELECT COUNT(value)           FROM table; -- 4 (counts non null values)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT value)  FROM table; -- 3 (counts distinct non null values)
SELECT COUNT(*)               FROM table; -- 5 (counts lines)
```

# Aggregate Functions

When using aggregate functions, all rows are grouped into a single row.

* By default values are sorted in **ascending** order.
* We can change the default order using the **ASC** and **DESC** clauses.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary ASC; -- default
```

.smaller.sqltable[
|id|name|salary|taxes|num|d_name
|-|-|
|1 | John Doe    | **700**  | 200 | 1 | Marketing
|2 | Jane Doe    | **800**  | 100 | 2 | Sales
|4 | Jane Roe    | **1000** | 200 | 3 | Production
|3 | John Smith  | **1500** | 350 | 2 | Sales
]

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;
```

# ORDER BY

* We can also sort by more than one column.
* When this happens, we first sort using the first column and if there is a tie we use the next column.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY taxes DESC, salary ASC;
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY taxes DESC, salary;     -- equivalent
```

.sqltable[
|id|name|salary|taxes|num|d_name
|-|-|
|3 | John Smith  | **1500** | 350 | 2 | Sales
|1 | John Doe    | **700**  | 200 | 1 | Marketing
|4 | Jane Roe    | **1000** | 200 | 3 | Production
|2 | Jane Doe    | **800**  | 100 | 2 | Sales

# Limiting Data

---

# LIMIT

The number of rows returned by a query can be limited using the **LIMIT** clause.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary LIMIT 2;
```

.sqltable[
|id|name|salary|taxes|num|d_name
|-|-|
|3 | John Smith  | **1500** | 350 | 2 | Sales
|4 | Jane Roe    | **1000** | 200 | 3 | Production
]

---

# OFFSET

When using the **LIMIT** clause, we can also indicate how many rows to skip using the **OFFSET** clause.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary LIMIT 2 OFFSET 1;
```

.sqltable[
|id|name|salary|taxes|num|d_name
|-|-|
|4 | Jane Roe    | **1000** | 200 | 3 | Production
|2 | Jane Doe    | **800**  | 100 | 2 | Sales
]

.box_info[Here the first line (with a salary of 1500) was skipped.]

---

# Pagination

**LIMIT** and **OFFSET** can be used to paginate our results.

.box_info[Example for page 3 with 10 results per page.]

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;
```

.box_info[Generically for page N with R results per page.]

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY id LIMIT R OFFSET R * (N - 1);
```

# A Complete Query

* A query will always start with the **SELECT** clause.
* All the other clauses are optional.
* But they always follow the same order.

```sql
SELECT c1, c2, SUM(c3), AVG(c4) AS c5
FROM t1 JOIN
     t2 ON t1.foreign_key = t2.primary_key JOIN
     t3 USING (join_column)
WHERE condition_1 AND (condition_2 OR condition_3)
GROUP BY c1, c2
HAVING AVG(c4) > 10
ORDER BY AVG(c4)
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 10
```

# LIKE

The **LIKE** operator can be used to compare strings using simple patterns.

* The **%** particle means zero or more characters
* The **_** character means exactly one character.

.smaller.sqltable[
|id|name
|-|-|
|1 | John Doe
|2 | Jane Doe
|3 | Jean Doe
|4 | Jennifer Doe
|5 | William Doe
]


```sql
SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE '% Doe'    -- All five rows
SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE 'J% Doe'   -- John, Jane, Jean and Jennifer
SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE 'J___ Doe' -- John, Jane and Jean
SELECT * FROM people WHERE name LIKE '_e%'      -- Jean and Jennifer
```

# Queries as Tables

The result of a query is a table. This allows us to use queries in the same
places we use tables.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT * FROM
        employees JOIN
        department USING(d_num)
      WHERE department.name = 'Logistics') AS logistic_employees JOIN
     works ON logistic_employees.id = works.id
WHERE works.hours > 10
```

.box_info[*Subqueries* must be named using the **AS** particle.]

# Subquery Expressions

Subquery expressions can be used to combine two queries in the **WHERE** or
**HAVING** clauses.

There are several subquery expressions:

```sql
expression IN subquery
expression NOT IN subquery
expression operator ANY (subquery) -- Same as SOME
expression operator ALL (subquery)
```

---

# IN and NOT IN

```sql
expression IN subquery
expression NOT IN subquery
```

These expressions test if a value (or values) exist (or not) in the subquery.

```sql
SELECT *               -- Employees whose id exists in the subquery
FROM employees
WHERE employee.id IN (
    SELECT emp_id      -- The ids of employees that work more
    FROM works         -- than 10 hours in projects
    GROUP BY emp_id
    HAVING SUM(hours) > 10
)
```

---

# ANY

```sql
expression operator ANY (subquery) -- Same as SOME
```

The **ANY** expression compares a value with every row of the subquery and
returns true if **at least one** of the comparisons returns true.

```sql
SELECT *               -- Employees that have a larger salary than at least
FROM employees         -- one logistics department employee
WHERE salary >= ANY (
    SELECT salary      -- All the salaries from logistic department employees
    FROM employees JOIN
      departments ON employees.d_num = department.num
)
```

.box_info[= ANY is the same as IN]

---

# ALL

```sql
expression operator ALL (subquery)
```

The **ALL** expression compares a value with every row of the subquery and
only returns true if **all** of the comparisons returns true.

```sql
SELECT *               -- Employees that have a larger salary than all of
FROM employees         -- the logistics department employees
WHERE salary >= ALL (
    SELECT salary      -- All the salaries from logistic department employees
    FROM employees JOIN
      departments ON employees.d_num = department.num
)
```

.box_info[<> ALL is the same as NOT IN]
