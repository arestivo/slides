# Types of Diagrams

In UML, there are two basic categories of diagrams: 
  
* **Structure** diagrams show the static structure of the system being modeled: *class*, *component*, *deployment*, *object* diagrams, ...

* **Behavioral** diagrams show the dynamic behavior between the objects in the system: *activity*, *use case*, **communication**, *state machine*, *sequence* diagrams, ...

---

# Communication Diagrams

Communication diagrams are a **simplified** version of a **sequence diagrams**.

The main difference is that **sequence** diagrams are good at showing **sequential logic** but not that good at giving you a **big picture view**.

# Objects

---

# Objects

Objects are **named elements** which represent a **individual participants** in the interaction.

An object is represented by a rectangle that identifies the participant element.

![](../assets/uml-communication/objects.svg)

The element can be an **anonymous** representative of a certain class, or a **named** one.

---

# Actors

An **Actor** is always something (a system or person) that is **outside** the **scope** of the system.

![](../assets/uml-communication/actor.svg)

Actors are drawn as **stickman** figures (although they may not be users), and can be participants in communication diagrams.

# Messages

---

# Messages

Messages are represented by a **line** with an arrow above that indicates the direction of the message (and a sequence expression).

# Sequence Expressions

---

# Sequence Expressions

The sequence expression is a dot (".") separated **list** of **sequence terms** followed by a colon (":") and **message name** after that:

```bash
term1.term2.term3:message
```

Each sequence term represents a **level** of procedural **nesting** within the **overall** interaction. Each sequence-term has the following syntax:

```bash
integer [ name ] [ recurrence ] 
```

![](../assets/uml-communication/sequence.svg)

---

# Sequence Order

The integer represents the sequential order of the message within the next higher level of procedural calling (**activation**). 

![](../assets/uml-communication/order.svg)

Messages that differ in one integer term are **sequential** at that **level of nesting**. 

---

# Sequence Name

The **name** represents a **concurrent thread** of control. Messages that differ in the final name are **concurrent** at that level of nesting. 

![](../assets/uml-communication/name.svg)

The hero instance send **both** requests (1.1a and 1.1b) to the Maze object **concurrently**.

---

# Sequence Recurrence

The recurrence of a sequence term can be a **guard** (a condition inside **square brackets**) or a **loop** (an **asterisk** followed by a condition inside **square brackets**).
