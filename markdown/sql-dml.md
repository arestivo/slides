# Introduction

#SQL

* **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage.
* A special purpose language to manage data stored in a **relational** database.
* Based on **relational algebra**.
* Pronounced *Sequel*

---

# History

* Early **70's** SEQUEL Developed at IBM
* **1986** SQL-86 and SQL-87 Ratified by ANSI and ISO.
* **1989** SQL-89
* **1992** SQL-92 Also know as SQL2.
* **1999** SQL:1999 Also known as SQL3 Includes regurlar expressions, recursive queries, triggers, non-scalar data types and some object-oriented expressions.
* **2003** SQL:2003 XML support and auto-generated values.
* **2006** SQL:2006 XQuery support.
* **2008** SQL:2008.
* **2011** SQL:2011.

# Standard

* Although SQL is an ANSI/ISO standard, every database system implements it in a slightly different way.
* These slides will try to adhere to the standard as much as possible.
* Sometimes we'll deviate and talk specifically about **PostgreSQL**.

# Inserting

To insert values into a table we use the **INSERT** command:

```sql
INSERT INTO <tablename> (<col1>, <col2>, ...) VALUES (<val1>, <val2>, ...);
```

Example:

```sql
INSERT INTO employee (id, name, salary) VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 1000);
```

---

# Inserting

We can ommit the column names if we insert the values in the same order we used to create the table columns.

```sql
INSERT INTO employee VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 1000);
```

# Deleting

---

# Deleting

* To delete value from a table, we use the **DELETE** command.
* The delete command can receive a **condition** specifying **which rows to delete**.
* If **no condition** is given **all rows are deleted** from the table.
* If there are foreign keys, the rule set by the **ON DELETE** clause is used.
* The condition can be as complex as those used on the **SELECT** command.

```sql
DELETE FROM <tablename> WHERE <condition>;
```

---

# Examples

Delete employee with id 1

```sql
DELETE FROM employee WHERE id = 1;
```

Delete all employees

```sql
DELETE FROM employee;
```

Delete employees with salary larger or equal to 1200

```sql
DELETE FROM employee WHERE salary >= 1200;
```

# Updating

# Updating

* To modify values from a table, we use the **UPDATE** command.
* The update command can receive a **condition** specifying **which rows to update**.
* If **no condition** is given **all rows are updated** from the table.
* If there are foreign keys, the rule set by the **ON UPDATE** clause is used.
* The condition can be as complex as those used on the **SELECT** command.
* New values can be calculated on the fly.

```sql
UPDATE <tablename> SET <col1> = <val1>, <col2> = <val2>, ... WHERE <condition>;
```

---

# Examples

Change the salary of employee 1 to 1500

```sql
UPDATE employee SET salary = 1300 WHERE id = 1;
```

Increase the salary of employee 1 by 10%

```sql
UPDATE employee SET salary = salary * 1.1 WHERE id = 1;
```

Increase the salary of all employees by 10%

```sql
UPDATE employee SET salary = salary * 1.1;
```

Decrease the salary and taxes of all employees with a salary larger than 1200 by 10%

```sql
UPDATE employee SET salary = salary * 0.9, taxes = taxes * 0.9 
WHERE salary > 1200;
```
