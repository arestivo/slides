# Introduction

---

# JavaScript

  * *JavaScript* is a **dynamic**, **imperative** and **functional** language.
  * In *JavaScript*, functions are considered **first-class** citizens.
  * It is also **object-oriented**, but **prototype-based** (not class-based).
  * Most commonly used as a **client-side** scripting language (in browsers).
  * But can also be used as a **general purpose** language.

---

# History

  * Originally developed by **Brendan Eich** at **Netscape**.
  * Developed under the name **Mocha** but later named **LiveScript**.
  * Changed name from LiveScript to **JavaScript**, in **1995**, when Netscape added support for Java.
  * Microsoft introduced JavaScript support in Internet Explorer in August **1996** (called JScript).
  * Submitted to **Ecma** International for consideration as an industry-standard in 1996 (**ECMAScript**).
  * Ecma International released the first version of the specification in **1997**.
  * Nowadays, JavaScript is a trademark of the **Oracle** Corporation.
  * But JavaScript is officially managed by the **Mozilla** Foundation.

---

# Console

* Modern browsers all have a *JavaScript* console that can log messages from within web pages.
* It can also inspect variables, evaluate expressions, and just plain experimentation.
* The specifics of how it works vary from browser to browser, but there is a *de facto* set of typically provided features.

* The **console.log(msg)** function outputs a message to the console:
```javascript
console.log('Hello World')
```
* Other debug level are possible: 
  * **console.info(msg)**, **console.warn(msg)** and **console.error(msg)**.
  * Browsers allow filtering messages depending on their level.

---

# Strict Mode

*ECMAScript 5* brought some significant changes. 

To opt-in for those changes, scripts (or functions) must start with:

```javascript
'use strict'
```

Some of those changes:

* **No more** global undeclared variables.
* **No more** declaring variables with **var**.
* Some warnings are now errors.

---

# Automatic Semicolons

Statements are separated by semicolons:

```javascript
console.log(123); console.log('abc');
```

But if a line break separates them:

```javascript
console.log(123);
console.log('abc');
```

The semicolon can be omitted:

```javascript
console.log(123)
console.log('abc')
```

.box_warning[
  This is true in most cases!

template: inverse
name: variables

# Variables

---

# Variables

* JavaScript is a *loosely/weakly* and *dynamically* typed language. 
* That means that:
  * values have types; variables do not.
  * types are checked at runtime.
* Variables are declared using the **let** command.
* Variable names must contain only letters, digits, $, and _ (and not start with a digit).

```javascript
let bar = 10       // bar initialized with a number
bar = 'John Doe'   // bar now has a string
bar = true         // and now a boolean
```

```javascript
let foo = 10, bar  // declaring two variables at once
bar = 'John Doe'   // bar was undefined 
```

---

# Constants

* Constants behave precisely the same way as variables.
* Except they can't be changed.
* Constants are declared using the **const** command.

```javascript
const bar = 10
bar = 20        // TypeError: invalid assignment to const `bar'
```

.box_info[
Always prefer **const**; only use **let** if you need to reassign the variable.
]

---

# Var

In older scripts, you might find variables declared using **var** instead of **let**.

* They have no block scope (only function scope).
* Are processed when a function starts.
* **And should not be used!**

```javascript
if (true) {
  var bar = '1234'
  console.log(bar)      // 1234
}

console.log(bar)        // 1234
```

```javascript
function foo() {
  bar = '1234'
  console.log(bar)     //1234
  var bar
}
```

---

# Not declaring variables

* Declaring variables in *JavaScript* might seem *optional*, but that is **not the case**.
* When you use a variable without declaring it, that variable will bubble up until it finds a variable declared with the same name.
* If it doesn't, it attaches itself to the *window* or *global* object.
* This might have unforeseen and complex to debug consequences:

```javascript
function foo() {
  bar = 1234
}

let bar = 10
foo()
console.log(bar) // 1234
```

---

# Primitive Data Types

The standard defines the following data types:

  * Number (**double**-precision 64-bit)
  * String (**text**ual data - single or double quoted)
  * Boolean (**true** or **false**)
  * BigInt (**numbers** of arbitrary length)
  * Null (only one possible value: case sensitive **null**)
  * Undefined (has **not** been **assigned** a value)

---

# Strings

Strings can be defined equally using single or double quotes:

```javascript
const firstname = 'John'
const lastname = "Doe"
```

We can also use *backticks*. With *backticks*, expressions inside 
*${...}* are evaluated, and the result becomes a part of the string.

```javascript
console.log(`Hello, ${firstname} ${lastname}!`)
// Hello, John Doe!

console.log(`The result is ${1 + 2}`)
// The result is 3
```

---

# The + Operator

The plus (+) operator sums numbers, but if one of the operands is a string, 
it converts the other one into a string and concatenates the two:

```javascript
console.log(11 + 31)   // 42
console.log('11' + 31) // '1131'
console.log(11 + '31') // '1131'
```

---

# Type Conversions

Most of the time, operators and functions automatically convert a value to the right type (type conversion). 

You can still use the *String*, *Number* and *Boolean* functions to manually convert a value:

```javascript
const a = 0
const b = Boolean(a) // false
const c = String(a)  // '0'
const d = String(b)  // 'false'
```

---

# Comparison

When comparing values belonging to different types, they are converted to numbers:

**Examples:**

```javascript
1 == '1'    // 1 == 1 -> true
0 == false  // 0 == 0 -> true
'0' == true // 0 == 1 -> false
'' == false // 0 == 0 -> true
Boolean('0') == false // 1 == 0 -> false
Boolean('0') == true  // 1 == 1 -> true
```

---

# Boolean Evaluation

The following values all evaluate to **false**:

  * false
  * undefined
  * null
  * 0
  * NaN (not a number)
  * the empty string

All other values, including objects, evaluate to **true**.

Be careful with the Boolean object:

```javascript
const foo = new Boolean(false)
const bar = Boolean(false)
if (foo) // evaluates to true
if (bar) // evaluates to false
```

---

# Strict Equality

* Strict equality compares two values for equality.  
* Neither value is implicitly converted to some other value before being compared.
* If the values have different types, the values are considered unequal.

```javascript
0 === 0     // true
0 === '0'   // false
0 === false // false
```

Comparing anything with **null** and **undefined** returns false. Comparisons between them have the following results:

```javascript
  null === undefined // false
  null == undefined  // true
```

---

name:control
template: inverse
# Control Structures

---

# If ... else

* Use the **if** statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is **true**.
* Use the optional **else** clause to execute a statement if the condition is **false**.

```javascript
if (condition) {
  //do domething
} else {
  //something else
}
```

---

# Switch

* A switch statement allows a program to evaluate an expression and 
  attempt to match the expression's value to a case label.
* If a match is found, the program executes the associated statement.

```javascript
switch (expression) {
   case label_1:
      statements_1
      break
   case label_2:
      statements_2
      break
   //...
   default:
      statements_def
      break
}
```

---

# Loops

JavaScript supports the **for**, **do while**, and **while** loop statements:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i)
} // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

```javascript
let i = 0
do {
   console.log(i)
   i++
} while (i <= 10) // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

```javascript
let i = 0
while (i <= 10) {
   console.log(i)
   i++
} // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

---

# Break and Continue

* The break statement finishes the current loop prematurely.
* The continue statement finishes the current iteration and continues with the next.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (i == 8) break
  if (i % 2 == 0) continue
  console.log(i)
} // 1 3 5 7
```

---

name:functions
template: inverse
# Functions

---

# Defining functions

A function is defined using the **function** keyword.

```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
  console.log(num1 + num2)
}

add(1, 2) // 3
```

* **Primitive** parameters are passed to functions by **value**.
* **Non-primitive** parameters (objects) are passed by **reference**.

---

# Return

Functions can also return values.

```javascript
function add(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2
}

console.log(add(1, 2)) // 3
```

A function with an empty *return* or no *return* at all, returns **undefined**.

---

# Default Values

* If a parameter expected by a function is not passed, it becomes **undefined**.
* Unless we declare a default value for that parameter.
* Default values can be complex expressions and are only calculated when needed.

```javascript
let count = 1

function bar() {
  return count++
}

function foo(var1, var2 = 1234, var3 = bar()) {
  console.log(var1, var2, var3)
}

foo(10, 20, 30) // 10 20 30
foo(10, 20)     // 10 20 1
foo(10)         // 10 1234 2
foo()           // undefined 1234 3
```

---

# Function Expressions

Another way to declare a function is the following:

```javascript
const foo = function() {
  console.log('bar')
}
```

This has the same effect as:

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log('bar')
}
```

Functions are just another datatype stored in variables. We can even copy them or display them in the console:

```javascript
const bar = foo
bar()
console.log(foo)
```

---

# Functions as Parameters

Functions can be passed as parameters to other functions.

```javascript
function foo(i) {
  console.log('bar = ' + i)
}

function executeNTimes(f, n) { // Executes function f, n times
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)
    f(i)
}

executeNTimes(foo, 3)   // bar = 1 bar = 2 bar = 3
executeNTimes(foo(), 3) // this is a common mistake
```

---

# Arrow Functions

A more compact way of declaring functions:

```javascript
const foo = function(var1, var2) {
  return var1 + var2
}
```

Is the same as:

```javascript
const foo = (var1, var2) => var1 + var2
```

Using the function from the previous slide:

```javascript
executeNTimes((i) => console.log(i * i), 3)  // 0 1 4
executeNTimes(i => console.log(i * i), 3)    // Even simpler
```

Multi-line arrow functions are also possible using a code-block **{...}**.

---

# Arrow Function Limitations

* Should not be used as methods (no *super* and no *this* binding, more on this later).
* Can not be used as constructors.
* Not ideal to use with *call*, *apply* and *bind* (more on this later).
* Cannot use *yield*.
* Multi-line arrow functions must have a return statement:

```javascript
const sum = (a, b) => {
  const result = a + b
  return result
}
```

---

name:objects
template: inverse
# Objects

---

# Objects

* JavaScript is designed on a simple **object-based** paradigm.
* An object is a collection of **properties**.
* A property is just an association between a **name** and a **value**.
* A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a **method**.
* JavaScript is a **prototype-based** language and **does not** have a class statement (or does it?).

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John Doe', age: 45 }

person.job = 'Driver'

console.log(person) 
// Object { name: 'John Doe', age: 45, job: 'Driver' }
```

---

# Methods

* Methods are properties of an object that happen to be functions.
* Methods are defined the way normal functions are defined, except that they are assigned as the property of an object.
* You can use the **this** keyword within a method to refer to the current object.

```javascript
const person = 
  { 
    name: 'John Doe',
    age: 45,
    car: {make: 'Honda', model: 'Civic'},
    print: function() {
      console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old!`)
    }
  }
person.print() // John Doe is 45 years old!
```

---

# Assigning Methods

We can also assign a method to an object:

```javascript
const person = 
  { name: 'John Doe',
    age: 45,
    car: {make: 'Honda', model: 'Civic'},
  }

person.print = function() {
  console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old!`)
}

person.print() // John Doe is 45 years old!
```
.box_warning[
  Did we just change a constant???
]

---

# Constant Objects

Like other types, constant objects cannot be reassigned:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John Doe' }
person = { name: 'Jane Doe' } // Error!
```

But we can change what's inside them:

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John Doe' }
person.name = 'Jane Doe'
```

---

# Getter and Setters

*Setter* and *getters*, accessor properties, are functions that execute on 
getting and setting a value, but behave like regular properties.

.small[
```javascript
const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    get fullName() {
      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
    },
    set fullName (name) {
      const words = name.split(' ')
      this.firstName = words[0]
      this.lastName = words[1]
    }
}

person.fullName = 'John Doe'
console.log(person.firstName)  // John
console.log(person.lastName)   // Doe
console.log(person.fullName)   // John Doe

person.firstName = 'Jane'
console.log(person.fullName)   // Jane Doe
```
]

---

# For ... in

The **for...in** statement iterates over all properties of an object.

```javascript
const person = { name: 'John Doe', age: 45 }

for (let key in person)
  console.log(`${key} = ${person[key]}`)

// name = John Doe
// age = 45
```

---

# Objects as Arrays

* Properties of objects can be accessed or set using a bracket notation.
* Objects can be seen as **associative arrays** since each property is 
  associated with a string value that can be used to access it.

```javascript
const person = {}

person['name'] = "John Doe"
person['age'] = 45

console.log(person.age)    // 45
console.log(person['age']) // 45
```

---

# Almost Everything is an Object

* In JavaScript, almost everything is an object.
* Even primitive types, except *null* and *undefined*, are temporarily *casted* into objects when treated as such.

```javascript
const num = 10
console.log(num.toExponential()) // 1e+1

const name = "John Doe"
console.log(name.substring(0,4)) // John
```

In this example, the primitive types are *cast* temporarily into Number and String objects and discarded afterward.

---

# Even Functions are Objects

They really are:

```javascript
function foo() { console.log("Hello") }
const bar = function() { console.log("Hello") }
const baz = () => console.log("Hello")

foo(); bar(); baz() // Hello Hello Hello

foo.info = "This function says hello!"
bar.info = "This function says hello!"
baz.info = "This function says hello!"

console.log(foo.info)  // This function says hello!

foo.goodBye = function() { console.log("Goodbye") }
foo.goodBye() //Goodbye
```

---

name:this
template: inverse
#This

---

# This

In *JavaScript*, the **this** keyword (current context) behaves unlike in almost any other language.

* In the global execution context, **this** refers to the *global object*:
  * Or *window* if in a browser.
* Inside a function it depends on how the function was called:
  * Simple function call (**undefined**).
  * Arrow functions (**retain** the enclosing context).
  * Using *apply* or *call* (*this* is the **first** argument).
  * Object method (the object the method was **called** from).
  * Browser Events (the object that **fired** the event, more on this later).

---

# This in functions

Using **this** in simple functions:

```javascript
function bar(var1, var2) {
  console.log(var1)
  console.log(var2)
  console.log(this)
}

bar(10, 20)                 // 10 20 undefined
bar.call('foo', 10, 20)     // 10 20 foo
bar.apply('foo', [10, 20])  // 10 20 foo
```

* **Call** and **apply** are alternative ways to call functions 
  that allow us to change the calling context (*this*).
* Both receive the **context** as the **first** argument.
* The remaining parameters are sent as **regular parameters** in *call* and as an **array** in *apply*.

---

# This in methods

In methods, *this* contains the object the method was called from:

```javascript
const foo = {}

foo.bar = function() { console.log(this) }
foo.baz = () => console.log(this)

foo.bar()     // Object { bar: f, baz: f }
foo.baz()     // Window or Global

const bar = foo.bar
const baz = foo.baz

bar()         // Window or Global
baz()         // Window or Global
```

---

name: prototypes
template: inverse
#Prototypes

---

# Constructor Functions

Functions (but not *arrow* functions) can be used to create new objects using the **new** keyword.

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name
  this.age = age
  this.print = function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old!`)
  }
}

const john = new Person("John Doe", 45)
john.print() // John Doe is 45 years old!
```

.box_info[
Cool! So, how does this work?
]

---

# Prototype

* Each *JavaScript* function has an internal **prototype** property initialized as a nearly empty object.
* When the **new** operator is used on a constructor function, a new object derived from its prototype is created. 
* The function is then executed, having the new object as its context.

```javascript
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name // this receives a nearly empty object
  this.age = age   // based on the function's prototype
  this.print = function() {
    console.log(`${this.name} is ${this.age} years old!`)
  }
}

const john = new Person("John Doe", 45)
john.print() // John Doe is 45 years old!
```

---

# Changing the Prototype

We can inspect and change the prototype of a function:

.small[
```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name
}

console.log(Person.prototype)       // {constructor: f}

const john = new Person("John Doe")
Person.age = 45                     // Only changes the Person function/object
                                    // not its prototype.
const jane = new Person("Jane Doe")
console.log(jane.age)               // undefined

Person.prototype.age = 45           // Changes the prototype.

const mary = new Person("Mary Doe") // All objects constructed using the
console.log(mary.age)  //45            person constructor now have an age.
console.log(jane.age)  //45            Even if created before the change.
```
]

.box_info[
What? How does THIS work?
]

---

# Prototype of Objects

Every object has a **prototype of the function** that created them.

It can be accesses with **Object.getPrototypeOf(obj)** and modified using **Object.setPrototypeOf(obj, pro)**.

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name
}

const john = new Person('John Doe')

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(john) === Person.prototype) 
// returns true

Object.setPrototypeOf(john, {}) 
// changes the prototype of john to {}
```

---

# The Prototype Chain

When we read a property from an object, and it‚Äôs missing, JavaScript will try taking it from the prototype of that object. 

And then from the prototype of that prototype, until it reaches *null*.

```javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name
}

const john = new Person("John")

Person.prototype.age = 45
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(john))// Object { age: 45, ... }
console.log(john.age)                   // 45

Object.setPrototypeOf(john, {})         // Changes the prototype
console.log(john.age)                   // undefined
```

Because **john.age** does not exist, but **Object.getPrototypeOf(john).age** does.

---

# Prototype Inheritance

Inheritance can be emulated with prototypes by changing the prototype chain.

```javascript
function Person(name) { this.name = name }

Person.prototype.print = function() { console.log(this.name) }

function Worker(name, job) {
  this.job = job
  Person.call(this, name)  // super constructor with this
}

Worker.prototype = new Person
Worker.prototype.print =
  function() { console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.job}`) }

const mary = new Person("Mary")
mary.print() // Mary

const john = new Worker("John", "Builder")
john.print() // John is a Builder
```

---

name:classes
template: inverse
#Classes

---

# Classes

* *Prototype-based* objects have many advantages (and disadvantages) over *class-based* objects.

* For example, we can do complicated meta-programming by manipulating the prototype chain.

* The original decision to use prototypes instead of classes in JavaScript as to do mainly with performance.

But why choose **one** when we can have **both**?

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  print() { 
    console.log(this.name) 
  }
}
```
---

# Syntatic Sugar

The *class* keyword is ([almost](https://javascript.info/class#not-just-a-syntactic-sugar)) just *syntactic sugar* for *prototype-based* objects:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name }
  print() { console.log(this.name) }
}
```

What's really happening:

- A function named Person is being created. 
- The function code is taken from the constructor method.
- Class methods, such as *print*, are stored in Person.prototype.

We can then use the **new** operator on that function just as we did before:

```javascript
const john = new Person('John Doe')
```

---

# Classes and the Prototype Chain

Inheritance is also just prototype chain manipulation:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name }
  print() { console.log(this.name) }
}

class Worker extends Person {
  constructor(name, job) {
    super(name)
    this.job = job
  }
  print() { console.log(`${this.name} is a ${this.job}`) }  
}

const john = new Worker("John", "Builder")
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Worker) === Person) 
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(john) === Worker.prototype) 
// both return true
```

---

# Classes Basic Syntax

* Classes can have **fields** (only very recently), **methods**, and a single **constructor**.
* The *this* keyword refers to the object that called the method.

```javascript
class Person {
  name     // undefined field
  age = 45 // a field initialized to a value

  constructor(name) { this.name = name } // a single constructor

  print() { console.log(this.name) }     // a method
}
```

The **new** operator creates a new instance of a class.

```javascript
const john = new Person('John Doe')
```

---

# Inheritance

Classes can extend other classes using the **extends** keyword.

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name) { this.name = name }
  print() { console.log(`My name is ${this.name}`) }
}

class Worker extends Person {
  constructor(name, job) {
    super(name)
    this.job = job
  }
  print() { 
    super.print()
    console.log(`And I'm a ${this.job}`) 
  }  
}
```
The **super** keyword allows calling the super-class constructor and methods.

---

# Static

The static keyword allows declaring fields and methods as being part of the class (not the object).

* They must be accessed using the class and not an object.
* Inside a **static** method, **this** refers to the class.

.small[
```javascript
class Person {
  static maxAge = 100

  constructor(name, age) { 
    this.name = name 
    this.age = age < Person.maxAge ? age : Person.maxAge
  }

  static compare(p1, p2) { return p1.name === p2.name && p1.age === p2.age }
}

const john1 = new Person('John Doe', 120)
const john2 = new Person('John Doe', 100)

console.log(Person.compare(john1, john2)) // true
console.log(john1.maxAge, Person.maxAge) // undefined 100
```
]

---

# Protected Fields and Methods 

* There is no *language-level* way to create protected fields.
* But there is a *well-established* convention that fields/methods starting with an *underscore* should not be accessed directly.
* We can use this convention and *getters/setters* to create a *read-only* property:

.small[
```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, age) { 
    this.name = name 
    this._age = age
  }

  get age() {
    return this._age    
  }
}

const john = new Person('John Doe', 45)

console.log(john.age) // 45
john.age = 50         // no error, but no effect
console.log(john.age) // 45
```
]

---

# Private Fields and Methods

* Unlike protected fields, there is a *language-level* way to create private fields.
* Like other field declaration aspects, this is still very recent and may not work everywhere.
* Private fields/methods are marked with a hash sign.

.small[
```javascript
class Person {
  name
  #age

  constructor(name, age) { 
    this.name = name 
    this.#age = age
  }

  #compare(other) { return this.name === other.name && this.age === other.age }
}

const john1 = new Person('John Doe', 45)
const john2 = new Person('John Doe', 55)

console.log(john1.age)             // undefined
console.log(john1.#age)            // error
console.log(john1['#age'])         // undefined
console.log(john1.#compare(john2)) // error
```
]

# Arrays

  * Arrays are **list-like objects** whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations.
  * *JavaScript* arrays are zero-indexed
  * Arrays can be initialized using a bracket notation:

```javascript
let years = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993]
console.log(years[0])     // 1990
years.info = "Nice array" // Arrays are objects
console.log(years.info)   // Nice array
```

Array elements are object properties, but they cannot be accessed using the **dot** notation because their names are invalid.

```javascript
let years = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993]
console.log(years[0]) // 1990
console.log(years.0)  // Syntax error
```

---

# Array Looping

You can use a **for** loop to iterate over array elements:

```javascript
let years = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993]
for (let i = 0; i < years.length; i++)
  console.log(years[i])
```

Or you can use a **for..of** loop:

```javascript
let years = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993]
for (const year of years)
  console.log(year)
```

.box_warning[
Do not use a **for ... in** loop! Those are for object properties.

# Array Prototype

These are some of the methods defined by the [Array prototype](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/prototype):

* Properties: prototype, length
* Mutators: fill, pop, push, reverse, shift, sort, splice, unshift
* Accessor: concat, contains, join, slice, indexOf, lastIndexOf
* Iterator: forEach, entries, every, some, filter

Some examples:

.small[
```javascript
let years = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993]
years.push(1994)
console.log(years.length)   // 5

years.reverse()
console.log(years)          // [1994, 1993, 1992, 1991, 1990]

let sum = 0
years.forEach(e => sum += e)
console.log(sum)            // 9960

years.every(e => e >= 1990) // true
years.some(e => e % 2 == 0) // true
```
]

---

# Playing with the Array Prototype

By changing the Array prototype, we can add methods and properties to all arrays.

```javascript
const years = [1990, 1991, 1992, 1993]

Array.prototype.print = function() {
  console.log("This array has length " + this.length)
}

years.print() // This array has length 4
```

# Exceptions

---

# Throw

* You can throw exceptions using the **throw** statement.
* You can throw any expression.

```javascript
function UserException (message){
  this.message = message
  this.name = "UserException"
}

UserException.prototype.toString = function (){
  return this.name + ": " + this.message
}

throw new UserException("Value too high")
```

```javascript
throw "This is an error"
```

---

# Error Object

If you are throwing your own exceptions, in order to take advantage of the name and message properties, you can use the **Error** constructor.

```javascript
throw new Error("This is an Error")
```

---

# Try ... Catch

The **try...catch** statement marks a block of statements to try, and specifies a response, should an exception be thrown.

```javascript
try {
  // code to try
}
catch (e) {
  // statements to handle any exceptions
}
```

---

# Finally

The **finally** block executes regardless of whether an exception is thrown. 

```javascript
try {
  // code to try
}
catch (e) {
  // statements to handle any exceptions
}
finally {
  // runs after the try and catch even if no exception is thrown on catched
}
```


---

# Catch a specific type of Exception

To distinguish between different types of exceptions we can use **instanceof**:

```javascript
try {
  // code to try
}
catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof DatabaseError) {
    // statements to handle DatabaseError exceptions
  } else if (e instanceof SomethingElseError) {
    // statements to handle SomethingElseError exceptions
  } else {
    // statements to handle other exceptions
  }
}
```
