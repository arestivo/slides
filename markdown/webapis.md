# Web APIs

In addition to describing HTML5 elements, the HTML 5 specification also introduces a set of *application programming interfaces* (APIs), that can be used by developers in their websites.

Most of these APIs are still under **heavy development**. Some have been discontinued, might be discontinued in the future, or heavily changed or never even see the light of day.

[W3 APIs Current Status](https://www.w3.org/standards/techs/js#w3c_all) |

# Permissions

---

# Permissions

Some of the new HTML 5 APIs provide powerful features and thus require an API to **query** the current permissions state, and **request**/**revoke** permissions by the users to use those features.

Currently, the HTML 5 standard describes permissions for the following APIs: 

```bash
geolocation, notifications, push, midi, camera, microphone, speaker, 
device-info, background-sync, bluetooth, persistent-storage, 
ambient-light-sensor, accelerometer gyroscope, magnetometer, clipboard.
```

---

# Permission State

To read the current permission state for a certain feature we must use the *navigator.permissions* interface:

```javascript
navigator.permissions.query({ name: "geolocation" }).then(({ state }) => {
  switch (state) {
    case "granted":
      break;
    case "prompt":
      break;
    case "denied":
      break;
  }
})
```

The result can be **granted** (the user already granted us the permission), **denied** (the user denied the permission, forever) or **prompt** (the use hasn't been asked yet). 

In this last case we can **try using** the desired Web API and the **browser will ask** the user for the necessary permission.

# Clipboard

# Clipboard API

The Clipboard API allows developers to:

* **Read** data from the clipboard
* **Change** the clipboard data
* **Detect** when the clipboard data changed
* **Intercept** clipboard actions and modify them

[W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/) | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Clipboard_API)

---

# Examples

Reading from the clipboard (not all browsers allow this):

```javascript
navigator.clipboard.readText().then(
  function (copiedText) {
    /* ... */
  }
)
```

Writing to the clipboard:

```javascript
navigator.clipboard.writeText(someValue)
```

Intercepting and changing copy events:

```javascript
document.addEventListener('copy', (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  e.clipboardData.setData('text/plain', 'Something else!')
})
```

# GeoLocation

---

# GeoLocation

The GeoLocation API allows a web app to ask the browser for it's current location. This can be done using several different methods (GPS, IP address, 3G triangulation, ...)

To get the current location of the user, we must use the *getCurrentPosition* function of the *navigator.geolocation* API.

This function receives two functions that are called, respectively, if the location was acquired or access to the user location was denied. It also receives a third parameter containing information about the request.

[W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/geolocation-API/) | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API)

---

# Example

```javascript
let geoSettings = {
  enableHighAccuracy: true,
  maximumAge        : 30000,
  timeout           : 20000
};

navigator.permissions.query({name:'geolocation'}).then(function(result) {
  if (result.state == 'granted') {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, denied, settings);
  } else if (result.state == 'prompt') {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(success, denied, settings);
  } else if (result.state == 'denied') {
    console.log('Already denied')
  }
  result.onchange = function() {
    console.log(result.state)
  }
})
```

---

# Example

Getting the coordinates:

```javascript
function success(position) {
  console.log(`Latitude: ${position.coords.latitude}`)
  console.log(`Longitude: ${position.coords.longitude}`)
}

function denied() {
  console.log('GeoLocation denied')
}
```

# Web Storage

# Web Storage

The Web Storage API allows web apps to store data in the browser. 

Web storage is **more secure** than *cookies*, and it allows for [large amounts](http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/) of data to be stored locally. It also doesn't rely on the **server** — like *session variables* do.

Unlike cookies — that are sent to the server using HTTP headers — data stored using the Web Storage API never leaves the browser.

[W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webstorage/) | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API)


---

# Storages

The Web Storage API can be accessed using two different interfaces:

* Window.localStorage - stores data with no expiration date, and gets cleared only through JavaScript, or clearing the Browser Cache.
* Window.sessionStorage - data is different for each tab/window and is cleared when the browser is closed.

Either way, data is private for each *server* / *protocol*.

---

# Storing, Retrieving and Removing

There are several different ways to store data but using the *setItem* method is recommended:

```javascript
localStorage.theme = 'dark'
localStorage['theme'] = 'dark'
localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')
```

There are also several different ways to retrieve data but using the *getItem* method is recommended:

```javascript
console.log(localStorage.theme)
console.log(localStorage['theme'])
console.log(localStorage.getItem('theme')
```

To delete data from storage, we can use the *removeItem* method:

```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('theme')
```

---

# Storage Events

When a storage changes, it fires a *storage* event. This event is received only in other windows from the same origin and only for the *localStorage*.

```javascript
window.addEventListener('storage', function(e) {  
  console.log(`${e.url} changed ${e.key} from ${e.oldValue} to ${e.newValue}`)
})
```

This can be used to synchronize data between different windows/tabs.

name: websockets
# Web Sockets

---

# Web Sockets

The web has always relied on the proven **client/server**, request/response paradigm.

XMLHTTPRequests and Ajax has started a small revolution but all communication was still **initiated by the client**. 

This means that when data changes on the server, the client only knows about it if the **user asks** for new data or if the data is **periodically polled** from the server.

---

# Long Polling

One solution to this problem is called **long polling**. 

When using long polling, the browser opens an HTTP connection to the server which **keeps it open** waiting for any changes to announce.

Although some problems, like keeping a server process occupying resources for each client, have already been solved, and in several different ways, HTTP connections aren't suited for **low latency** applications (games for example).

---

# Web Sockets

Web Sockets allow opening a two-way interactive communication session between the browser and the server.

This allows the server to push updates instantaneously to the browser instead of waiting for the browser to ask if the data changed.

[W3 Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/websockets/) | [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)

---

# The Server

A WebSocket server is a **TCP application** listening on any port of a server that follows a specific protocol. 

The protocol comprises several steps:

* **Handshake** (request / response)
* Keeping track of **clients**
* Exchanging **data** frames
* Checking if **connected** (ping and pongs)
* **Closing** the connection

But we're not going to discuss the protocol in detail. It is recommended that you use a proven solution. For PHP, [Ratchet](http://socketo.me/) is the most known and used Web Sockets library.

---

# The Client

On the client side, things are a little bit easier.

To connect to a Web Socket server we just have to create a socket:

```javascript
let conn = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080')
```

When the connection is established, a *open* event is fired:

```javascript
conn.addEventListener('open', function() {
  console.log("Connection established!");
})
```

And every time a message is received from the server a *message* event is fired:

```javascript
conn.addEventListener('message', function(e) {
  console.log(e.data)
})
```

name: workers
# Web Workers

---

# Web Workers

Make it possible to run a script operation in a background thread separate from the main execution thread of a web application. 

```javascript
const worker = new Worker('web-worker.js');

worker.postMessage(20)

worker.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log(`Main received ${event.data}`);
}
```

On *web-worker.js*:

```javascript
self.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log(`Worker received ${event.data}`);
  self.postMessage(event.data * 10);
}
```

---

# Service Workers

Act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They include features like push notifications and background sync. 

```javascript
navigator.serviceWorker.register('service-worker.js');
```

On *service-worker.js*:

```javascript
self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
  console.log('Install')
})

self.addEventListener('activate', function(event) {
  console.log('Activate')
})

// Listen for network requests from the main document
self.addEventListener('fetch', function(event) {
  caches.match(event.request).then(function(response){
    console.log('Response: ' + response)
    return response || fetch(event.request)
  })
})
```

# Other APIs

* **IndexedDB** is a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This API uses indexes to enable high-performance searches of this data. 
* The **Web Crypto** is an interface allowing a script to use cryptographic primitives in order to build systems using cryptography: digest, sign, verify, hash, encrypt, decrypt...
* The **Pointer Lock** gives you access to raw mouse movement, locks the target of mouse events to a single element, eliminates limits on how far mouse movement can go in a single direction, and removes the cursor from view ([demo](https://aristocrates.github.io/pointer-lock-demo/)).
* **Page Visibility** provides events you can watch for to know when a document becomes visible or hidden.
* **Web Notifications** - Why does this even exist?!? No, I don't want your darn notifications!
